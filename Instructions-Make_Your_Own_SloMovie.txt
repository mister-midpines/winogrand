# Instructions (Additional notes are pasted below.)

# To get started:
# - Get your preferred movie, in *.mp4 format
# - Clone the SloMovie_Template into your own SloMovie repository, named for the movie.
# - Set up the new repository as a web site using <go to repository> -> Settings ->
#   Pages [in sidebar] -> Build and Deployment, then Set Branch to Main
# - Install imagemagick and ffmpeg
# - The scripts below are written to run in the bash shell

# Specify the name of the movie as a bash variable
movie_name="alien" # Make sure this matches its name in github

# Subsequent commands split a movie in mp4 format into frames, and incrementally modify
# them to a format that will look good on a TRMNL.

# Make directories to hold the intermediate edited images
mkdir orig_frames gray_frames contrast_frames cropped_frames for_github

# Strip frames out of the mp4 movie with the name above
ffmpeg -i "$movie_name".mp4 -r 1 %04d.png
wait

# Skim through the frames manually, and delete any you don't want, such as excessive
# blank/black frames at the beginning and end of the movie.

# Renumber and rename files after removing unwanted frames
i=0
for orig_filename in *.png
do
      	    ((i+=1))
            new_number=$(printf "%04.0f" $i)
            mv "$orig_filename" "seq-$new_number.png"
done
wait

cp *.png orig_frames

# NOTE: Image Magick throws a warning over this. Ignore it.
for j in *.png
    do

#-----------------------------
# Pause here to check the brighness and contrast in the images created by the previous command.
# Change them by experimenting with the command below to find parameters that work.

# Change brightness and contrast

# Move the new SloMovie files onto github.
